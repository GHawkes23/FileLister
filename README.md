File Lister is a tool created to list out all files of a given type in a directory and all of it's sub directories into a given file format</br>
The included .exe file is a fully contained version that can be dropped into a directory and run, but requires the right JDK to be installed</br>
&emsp;When run the terminal will appear with 2 prompts:&emsp;&emsp;('.' is optional in both responses)</br>
&emsp;&emsp;What file token are you looking for?</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This is the target filetype you're looking to list</br>
&emsp;&emsp;What format should the output be?</br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This is the file format that the outputted file should be (ex. csv or txt)</br>
&emsp;The program will repeat these questions until 'exit' is entered</br>
&emsp;The output will be visible in the directory the program was run in, and will be titled All<FileType>.<OutputType>
&emsp;This can be helpful for listing all files of a given type in a directory as a spreadsheet
